## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Here, I have implemented some of my learning which I have gotten from my previous project threw discord's community feedback for improvement and clarity on them after applying them in this project

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img src="avatar-jessica.jpeg" alt="author" />
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  min-height: 100svh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  @media screen and (max-width: 30rem);
}
```

### Continued development

I am still not comfortable with uses of dispaly property and responsive design for different devices
